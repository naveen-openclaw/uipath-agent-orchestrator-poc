# EB-1A Context: "Enterprise Agent Orchestration"

**Strategy: Product Impact & Original Contributions**
This POC demonstrates your expertise in designing scalable **Multi-Agent Systems** for Enterprise IT.

## Why This Matters (Evidence Pillars)

1.  **Architectural Innovation:**
    - Moving beyond simple "RAG Chatbots" to **Agentic Workflows**.
    - Implementing the **Orchestrator Pattern** (Triage -> Specialist -> Tool Execution).
    - Showing mastery of **Stateful Handoffs** (preserving context between agents).

2.  **Enterprise Relevance:**
    - Solves real business problems (IT Support Ticket Deflection).
    - Uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** simulation (Identity vs. Access agents).
    - Aligns with **UiPath's Strategic Direction** (GenAI + Automation).

## Execution Checklist (for Evidence Capture)

- [ ] **Run Trace Logs:** Capture the console output showing the "Handoff" event (Orchestrator -> Access Agent).
- [ ] **Mermaid Diagram:** Run `uipath init` and screenshot the generated `agent.mermaid` diagram. This proves visual architecture design.
- [ ] **Orchestrator Dashboard:** Deploy to UiPath Cloud and screenshot the job execution logs showing successful tool calls.
- [ ] **LinkedIn Post:** Share the architecture diagram with a caption about "Standardizing Agent Handoff Protocols in Enterprise Automation."

## Next Level (Upgrade Path)

- **Publication:** Write a Medium article comparing this "Code-First Agent" approach vs. "Studio-First" workflows.
- **Community:** Present this pattern at the next Dallas UiPath Meetup.
- **Hackathon:** Use this structure as the backend for the "Microsoft Agents League" entry if the rules allow custom backends.
